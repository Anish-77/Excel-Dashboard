# Excel-Dashboard
An Excel dashboard is a visual representation of data that provides a consolidated and interactive view of key metrics, trends, and insights. It typically consists of a collection of charts, graphs, tables, and other visual elements that are organized on a single page or a set of interconnected sheets within a Microsoft Excel workbook.
